# Pocket Stylist

# Description
This formed the practical part of my NEA for A-Level Computer Science. 

This is an app designed to recommend outfits from pieces in your wardrobe, that adapts to your preferences using collaborative filtering.


Through this project I gained an understanding of full-stack development, employing basic AI algorithms and more.
In future, this could be extended to recommend pieces to shop from (and suggest outfits they would pair well with) and more.
